    "\n",
    "1. **Original Code Review**: \n",
    "   - You provided code that analyzed patient data to assess the effects of a vaccine using bootstrapping and hypothesis testing. It calculated changes in health scores and performed both two-tailed and one-tailed hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Concepts Discussed**:\n",
    "   - **Health Score Change Calculation**: The change in health scores was computed by subtracting the initial score from the final score.\n",
    "   - **Bootstrapping**: Used to estimate the distribution of health score changes and compute confidence intervals.\n",
    "   - **P-Value Calculation**: Originally set up for a two-tailed test, which assesses deviations in both directions (improvements and declines).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Adjustments for One-Sided Test**:\n",
    "   - You asked for modifications to conduct a one-sided hypothesis test. The code was adjusted to focus only on the direction of interest (increases), changing how the p-value was calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation of Hypothesis Tests**:\n",
    "   - A one-tailed test focuses on significant increases, while a two-tailed test assesses both increases and decreases. This changes the hypothesis test’s interpretation and the conclusions drawn from the p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **P-Value Expectations**:\n",
    "   - In general, a one-tailed p-value is expected to be smaller than a two-tailed p-value for the same dataset since the one-tailed test only considers one direction for significance.\n",
